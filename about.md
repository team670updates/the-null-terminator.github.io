I am just a kid who writes bad code and messes around with homemade electronics of questionable safety. Nothing new, right?

More specifically this site is a place to document the projects my friend and I work on. Besides being a portfolio for college apps, we want this site to be a resource and something you can learn from....also as a memorial to all our sadly failed experiments...
