title: "An attempt to make an arc welder"

Our goal here is simple: make something to melt metal, cheaply and with materials we had on hand.
Since microwave oven transformers (MOTs) are easy to find (and often free), we decided to build an
arc welder out of rewound MOTs. 
For MOTs, you have a primary coil, and a secondary coil with a lot more turns to get
the high voltage output. However, for this project, we rewound 2 MOTs, keeping the primary coils but rewinding the 
secondaries with 10 AWG wire. Power is supplied from 120V AC mains.

With 1 MOT:

We are using carbon rods as the electrodes.

Now with both MOTs:

Our setup:

We were trying to melt some copper; the arcs are very bright and proper caution is necessary working with these.

RESULTS:

We tried melting aluminum and copper scrap. After running the melter on-and-off for around 10 minutes, we got 
some melted aluminum and copper. Not all was melted; for that 
we will try more power...

Unfortunately, one of the electrodes was accidentally held against a brick for too
long and there is now a hollow on the brick...
