Here we have a ZVS (zero voltage switching) driver with a flyback transformer from an old TV. 


We tried using the ZVS-driven flyback transformer in a Jacob's Ladder. As you can see we got some pretty nice arcs:

The high pitched screeching noise they make is a bonus.


We were trying to create a Marx generator with it, so far with 3 stages we have gotten a small arc. Further developments will have to wait, as some of our resistors 
were burned and will have to be replaced.  Right now it looks like this:

I will post a writeup about theory behind the ZVS driver and more about the Marx generator soon.
